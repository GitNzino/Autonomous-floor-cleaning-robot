# Autonomous-floor-cleaning-robot
This is the .ino code file(arduino) for the autonomous floor cleaner hardware made as a Design Practicum Project.
Process Sheet :
Base of track : Its made from aluminium sheet, having dimensions : 25cm X 20cm and is prepared by us in the mechanical workshop.
Earlier, we were thinking of using polycarbonate sheet and metal rods, but the idea was discarded after making the frame when we realized that it was indeed heavy.

Wheels : Four Rubber wheel having dimensions : 7cm X 2cm  have been used.

Vacuum Cleaner: A DC vacuum cleaner of power rating 60W and 12V has been integrated in the robot. It clears the dust of sorts on the floor.

Ultrasonic Sensors : Four ultrasonic sensors, 2 in front, 1 on either sides have been placed so as to detect any wall or obstacle and give accurate readings of distances for distances ranging from 0cm to 2m.
Earlier, a thought of using IR sensors was given but the idea was later rejected due to inaccuracy of IR sensors.

Magnetometer Sensor : Features precision in-axis sensitivity and linearity. This sensor's solid-state construction with very low cross-axis sensitivity is designed to measure both the direction and the magnitude of Earth's magnetic fields.

Arduino Mega 2560 : This microcontroller has been used to connect all the electronic equipments, and supply power to all the motors, motor drivers, sensors, vacuum cleaner etc.

Motor Drivers : Two L293D motor drivers have been used to control the four DC geared motors.

Li-Po battery : 4200mAh Li-Po battery has been used to power all the components.

SPECIFICATIONS:
Power Consumption:35 Watts
Speed:30 cm/s
Weight:2.9 kg
Running Time:30 minutes
